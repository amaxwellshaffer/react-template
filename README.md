## React App Template

This repo is a basic template for a standard React App. 
All the largely unused files and code from a basic react initialization have been removed. 

### Dependencies

The following additional dependencies are included:
* react-router-dom
* dotenv

### Not Included

No styling libraries, such as bootstrap, reactstrap or material UI have been installed.
The testing functions and HTML metadata have been largely removed. 
App.css has been cleared. Index.css has the default families commented out as a reference. 

### Other things to note

favicon.ico and the reference to it in index.html have been saved to make changing it easier. 
No explicit file structure has been laid out other than a components file in src. 
Other folders to possibly add to src:
* environments
* assets
